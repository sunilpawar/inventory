  * Customers can buy one product at a time.  
  * They can buy another product in a separate signup process, products belong to the same/different membership types.  
  * Customers can have multiple memberships of the same types.  
  * In Case of installment we need to have a supported payment processor and its codebase for civicrm.  
  * In case autopay for membership: We have to check the amount for membership renewal, it may not be the same as the customer paying on first time device purchase. [https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22152](https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22152) (auto renewal)  
  * Business logic to get the right amount for each item in sales order based on user actions. [https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22052](https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22052)  (including tax receipt)  
  * Payment processor : [https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22023](https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22023) 

* **Entity Type**   
  * **InventoryShipment**  
  * **InventoryShipmentLabels**  
    * **Shipping**  
      * Devices are scanned and assigned to order in civicrm\_inventory\_sales table.  
      * Shipments are done using batches with 40-50 orders in each batch.  
      * Labels are generated once Shipment is frozen.  
      * Each order gets shipping labels from the shipping service provider. It includes tracking urls too.  
      * Labels are printed in 2x2 or 2x4 size in a pdf file then printed on a sticky page.  
      * Shipping label scanned (bar code) and assigned to order record.  
      * And it sticks on packages.  
      * Recipe is generated with all warranty details present and put in the package. ([warranty](https://projects.skvare.com/issues/22513) )  
      * Once all orders have labels. Change the shipping status. It's ready for shipment.  
      * Once shipment is delivered, using API we can update shipping status to â€˜completed\` (need to check number of status required on each step).  
      * Product are assigned to Sale ID  
        * Table:

  * If a customer required device replacement.  
  * Fault product is sent.  
  * Membership is expired  
  * Expired Membership renewed.

		Then we prepare the CSV with appropriate status and send it to mobile citizens to activate,de-activate, and suspend service of the device.
